### Localization

We want to support as many languages as possible. If you would like to submit translations please submit them as pull request.

### Extending

Please do! We designed this to be as modular as possible. New shields buildings can be added by extending Building_ShieldBase. New shield types are best added as comps similar to Comp_ShieldRadial. New handlers should be added by registering a Harmony patch, use ProjectileHandler as a sample.
